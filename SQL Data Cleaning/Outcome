üßπ SQL Data Cleaning Project ‚Äì Nashville Housing Dataset
Tools Used: Microsoft SQL Server
Objective: To clean and prepare raw housing data for reliable analysis and reporting by resolving inconsistencies, null values, duplicates, and structural issues.

üîç Key Tasks Performed:
Date Standardization

Converted inconsistent SaleDate values to a proper DATE format.

Created a new column SaleDateConverted to preserve the original data integrity.

Handling Missing Values

Identified and filled missing PropertyAddress values using JOIN on ParcelID, ensuring address completeness without guessing data.

Address Normalization

Split compound fields like PropertyAddress and OwnerAddress into separate columns:

Address, City, State

Used SUBSTRING() and PARSENAME() for structured parsing of values.

Data Standardization

Cleaned the SoldAsVacant column by converting inconsistent values (Y/N) to standardized (Yes/No) formats using CASE statements.

Duplicate Removal

Implemented a CTE with ROW_NUMBER() to detect and delete exact duplicate rows based on key identifiers like ParcelID, SalePrice, SaleDate, etc.

Data Optimization

Dropped redundant and unused columns (PropertyAddress, OwnerAddress, TaxDistrict, SaleDate) after creating cleaned alternatives.

‚úÖ Outcome:
Delivered a clean, reliable, and analysis-ready dataset optimized for reporting, visualization, and deeper insights.

Demonstrated proficiency in advanced SQL functions, including JOIN, ISNULL, CTE, ROW_NUMBER(), SUBSTRING(), CASE, and ALTER TABLE.

Ensured data accuracy, consistency, and efficiency‚Äîessential for any data pipeline or BI workflow.
