üìä SQL Data Exploration Project ‚Äì COVID-19 Global Analysis
Tools Used: Microsoft SQL Server
Dataset: COVID-19 Global Deaths & Vaccination data (sourced from Our World in Data)
Objective: To explore, analyze, and derive meaningful insights from the COVID-19 dataset using SQL, with a focus on infections, deaths, vaccinations, and global trends.

üîç Key Tasks & Analysis Performed:
Data Preparation & Filtering

Removed irrelevant or incomplete records (continent IS NOT NULL) to ensure only valid, region-specific data was analyzed.

Selected essential columns for analysis: location, date, population, total_cases, total_deaths, new_cases, new_vaccinations.

Infection & Mortality Analysis

Analyzed total cases vs total deaths to calculate the Death Percentage for each country and tracked its trend over time.

Assessed total cases vs population to identify the infection rate as a percentage of population, with country-wise breakdowns.

High-Impact Country Identification

Ranked countries by highest infection rate (cases vs population).

Ranked countries and continents by total death count to identify worst-affected areas.

Continental & Global Aggregations

Aggregated data at the continent level to visualize macro-level impacts.

Computed global totals for new cases, deaths, and overall global death percentage.

Vaccination Progress Analysis

Used JOIN across the deaths and vaccinations datasets to analyze progress over time.

Applied window functions (SUM OVER PARTITION BY) to calculate rolling totals of vaccinated people per country.

Population vs Vaccination Coverage

Created a CTE (WITH PopVsVac) to compute and compare vaccinated population % per country.

Assessed each country‚Äôs vaccination progress in relation to its population.

View Creation for Visualization

Created a SQL View PercentPopulationVaccinated to store cleaned and aggregated vaccination data for easy integration with BI tools like Power BI or Tableau.

‚úÖ Outcome:
Delivered a comprehensive exploratory analysis covering infection trends, death rates, and vaccination coverage globally and per continent.

Gained insights on COVID-19 impact disparities between countries and continents.

Demonstrated strong SQL skills including:

Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, Views, Aggregations, and Conditional Logic.

Prepared a dataset ready for data visualization and storytelling in Power BI/Tableau dashboards.
